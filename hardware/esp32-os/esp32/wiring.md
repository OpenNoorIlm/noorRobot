# NoorRobot ESP32 -- Wiring Reference

This documents every physical connection the ESP32 firmware in this folder
(`esp32.ino` and its headers) actually uses. Board support ranges from a
plain ESP32 DevKit to ESP32-S3 N32R16V (see `capability.h`), so pin numbers
below assume a standard ESP32 DevKit's GPIO numbering -- if you're on a
different variant, cross-check against your specific board's pinout
diagram before wiring, since GPIO-to-physical-pin mapping is NOT identical
across ESP32 families.

---

## 1. ESP32 <-> Companion Arduino (robot control)

Used by `robot_api.h` to send movement/sensor/fan/eye commands to a
separate Arduino board that actually drives the motors, servos, distance
sensor, fan, and LED "eyes."

| ESP32 pin      | Arduino pin | Notes                        |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| GPIO17 (TX2)   | RX          | ESP32 transmits commands here |
| GPIO16 (RX2)   | TX          | ESP32 receives replies here   |
| GND            | GND         | **Common ground is required** |

- UART2, baud **9600**, configured in `robot_api.h`:
  `ArduinoSerial.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1, 16, 17);`
- TX/RX are crossed as usual: ESP32 TX -> Arduino RX, ESP32 RX -> Arduino TX.
- This is entirely separate from the main USB/UART0 serial below -- don't
  confuse the two when probing with a multimeter or logic analyzer.

---

## 2. ESP32 main UART0 (TX0/RX0 -- same as USB)

Used for boot logs, WiFi connection status, and the periodic IP address
print (see `esp32.ino`'s `setup()`/`loop()`).

| Signal | Notes                                                        |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| TX0    | Same physical pin broken out on most DevKits as "TX0"/"TXD"   |
| RX0    | Same physical pin broken out on most DevKits as "RX0"/"RXD"   |
| GND    | Common ground with whatever you're monitoring this with       |

- Baud **115200**, set in `esp32.ino`: `Serial.begin(115200);`
- If flashing/monitoring over the same USB cable, you don't need to wire
  anything extra -- the onboard USB-to-UART bridge chip already connects
  to these same UART0 pins internally.
- **ESP32-S3 caveat**: if "USB CDC On Boot" is enabled in board settings,
  `Serial` is rerouted to the native USB peripheral instead of the
  physical TX0/RX0 pins. Disable that setting if you need the IP prints
  on the physical pins rather than over USB.

## 3. BOOT button (GPIO0) -- force WiFi setup mode

Used by `wifi_manager.h`. Holding this LOW at power-up forces the ESP32
into its WiFi setup Access Point, even if credentials are already saved.

| ESP32 pin | Connection                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| GPIO0     | Momentary switch to GND (pulled up internally) |

- On virtually every ESP32 DevKit this is **already wired to the onboard
  "BOOT" button** -- no extra wiring needed.
- If you're using a bare ESP32 module with no onboard button, wire GPIO0
  to GND through a momentary push-button; `pinMode(GPIO0, INPUT_PULLUP)`
  is already set in code, so no external pull-up resistor is needed.

---

## 4. SD card module (SPI) -- optional, for `storage --change`

Used by `fs_manager.h` when the storage backend is switched to `sd` via
the shell's `storage --change` command. Standard ESP32 VSPI bus.

| ESP32 pin        | SD module pin | Notes                                  |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| GPIO5             | CS            | Configurable via `SD_CS_PIN` in `fs_manager.h` |
| GPIO23            | MOSI          | VSPI default                             |
| GPIO19            | MISO          | VSPI default                             |
| GPIO18            | SCK           | VSPI default                             |
| 3.3V              | VCC           | See voltage note below                   |
| GND               | GND           | Common ground                            |

- **Voltage note**: many SD breakout modules include an onboard 3.3V
  regulator and level shifter, and will happily accept 5V on VCC -- but
  some are 3.3V-only. Check your specific module's silkscreen/datasheet
  before connecting; feeding 5V logic directly into a 3.3V-only SD card
  will damage it.
- Only **CS** is dedicated to the SD card -- MOSI/MISO/SCK are the shared
  VSPI bus and would be reused if you ever add another SPI device.
- If `storage --change` reports it couldn't detect a card, double check
  this wiring and that a card is actually inserted before retrying --
  the firmware validates the card works *before* saving the preference,
  specifically so a bad connection here can't lock you out of storage.

## 5. 2.8" ILI9341 TFT SPI display

Library: **TFT_eSPI** (Bodmer). Configure `User_Setup.h` with:
`#define ILI9341_DRIVER`, `TFT_MISO 19`, `TFT_MOSI 23`, `TFT_SCLK 18`, `TFT_CS 5`, `TFT_DC 2`, `TFT_RST 4`

| ESP32 pin | TFT module pin | Notes                          |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| GPIO5     | CS             | Chip select                    |
| GPIO2     | DC / RS        | Data / command                 |

| GPIO18    | SCK / CLK      | VSPI clock                     |
| GPIO27    | BL / LED       | Backlight (pulled HIGH in code)|
| 3.3V      | VCC            | **3.3V only**                  |
| GND       | GND            |                                |

## 6. XPT2046 touch controller (on same PCB as ILI9341)

Uses a **separate HSPI bus** (to avoid CS conflicts with the display).

| ESP32 pin | XPT2046 pin | Notes                                   |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| GPIO22    | T_CS        | Touch chip select (separate from TFT_CS)|
| GPIO13    | T_DIN / MOSI| HSPI MOSI                               |
| GPIO12    | T_DO / MISO | HSPI MISO                               |
| GPIO14    | T_CLK / SCK | HSPI clock                              |
| -         | T_IRQ       | Not used — polling mode                 |
| 3.3V      | VCC         |                                         |
| GND       | GND         |                                         |

⚠️ **Run `hwtest` from NoorShell after first flash to calibrate touch.**
Calibration is saved to `/sys/touch_cal.txt` and loaded automatically on boot.

## 7. PAM8403 amplifier + speakers (audio)

ESP32 DAC (GPIO25) → PAM8403 IN → 2× 3W 8Ω speakers

| ESP32 pin | PAM8403 pin | Notes                                  |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| GPIO25    | L IN / R IN | DAC1 output (mono — tie both channels) |
| GND       | GND         | Common ground                          |
| 5V        | VCC         | PAM8403 needs 5V for full power        |
| -         | OUT L/R     | Connect to speakers                    |

- DAC1 = GPIO25. DAC2 = GPIO26 (reserved / laser control)
- GPIO25 **not** shared with Hall sensor (moved to GPIO21)
- Volume controlled by `robot.volume(0-100)` in Lua / `volume 80` in shell

## 8. Sensors (all on ESP32)

| ESP32 pin | Sensor          | Signal type  | Notes                          |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| GPIO32    | DHT11           | 1-wire       | Temperature + humidity         |
| GPIO13    | HC-SR04 TRIG    | Digital OUT  | Ultrasonic trigger             |

| GPIO39    | Sound sensor    | Analog IN    | 0–4095                         |
| GPIO21    | Hall/magnetic   | Digital IN   | Moved from GPIO25/34           |
| GPIO26    | Laser emitter   | Digital OUT  | Pull HIGH to fire              |

⚠️ GPIO34/35/36/39 are **input-only** on ESP32 — no internal pull-up, no output.
